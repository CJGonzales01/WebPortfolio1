<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: "Open Sans, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bolder;">Hello, I am Juan Carlos Gonzales,</span> a 4th-year Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at Mapua Malayan Colleges Laguna. With a solid foundation in both front-end design and back-end database management, I am passionate about developing web solutions that are not only efficient but also highly effective.

    Throughout my academic journey, I have gained extensive experience in front-end design, where I enjoy bringing creative ideas to life through clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows me to create visually appealing and functional websites that enhance user experience.
    
    In addition to my front-end skills, I possess a strong understanding of back-end technologies, particularly in database management. I am well-versed in SQL and have hands-on experience working with various database systems. This combination of front-end and back-end expertise enables me to build comprehensive web applications that are robust and scalable.
    
    My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to create web solutions that can make a positive impact on people's lives globally.
